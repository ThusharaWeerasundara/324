CO324 Lab 5: Stateful systems

EX 1 (a) and (b) implemented in codes

EX 2 (d) and EX 3 implemented in codes


EX 2 (c) answer is in taskstate-fsm.pdf

EX 2 (e)
Can a task ever make an illegal transition due to a race condition during update? Explain why (not.)

No,
FSM is designed in a way it does not do any illegal transitions of states for Tasks.Some users may not know the real state of a Task due to race conditions(state transitions may occur 
withot the knowledge of the user), FSM will produce an suitable error message if there are any illeagal requests of transition. Otherwise state transition will occur.
