CO324 Lab 3: Exploring APIs with the Requests 3 module

Ex1

(a) 
We see urls/directories in API root endpoint https://api.github.com

(c)
X-Ratelimit headers are not genaral set of headers. They are extended set of headers which are specific to a API. These
headers are used for rate limiting for http. Most APIs are subject to a limit on how many calls can be made in a certain
time period, to prevent servers from being overloaded and maintain a good service to clients. For this purposes APIs use
X-Ratelimit headers. In githu api we see 3 X-Ratelimit headers. They are,

X-Ratelimit-Limit 		: The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per hour
X-Ratelimit-Remaining 	: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
X-Ratelimit-Reset		: The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds

(d)
In http there is a header called Authorization which used to authenticate an user. 

with requests.Session() as session:
    session.headers['Authorization'] = 'token YOUR_PAT_STRING'

This code creates an instance of Session class to make https requests. Also in here we initialize Authorization header
using the token given by github. Therefore when making a request instead of using username and password, server can
authenticate the user using token.
