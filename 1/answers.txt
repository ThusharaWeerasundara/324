1.

(a). Inside load_users_to_lists function we open a txt file. Without closing the file manually
	 we can do the file open and other operations in a with block. At the end of the block
	 file will be closed and resources will be released. Even if there was an exception in
	 writing to the file with block closes the file at the end properly. Basically with block
	 manages file resources.

(b). In the function, 2 lists are returned as a tuple.


2.

(c). It returns a zip object. It creates an iterator that aggregate elements from 2 or more  
	 iterables, in this case 2 lists. Elements in input arguments are grouped according to
	 their positions.(nth item of pased iterators will mapped together)

(d). Inside the zip object, in all the elements, members will swap positions. Elements in
	 login become the 1st and ids become the 2nd element.

3.

(e). By using, users[id] we can access login value using id as key.(users is the name of the dictionary and id is the key)

(f). without doing users[id] = login, swap id and login as
	 users[login] = id 
	when we enter the values to thr dictionary. Then login becomes the key and id becomes the value

(g). without doing id, login = line.split(),

	 row = line.strip()  			#to remove useless spaces and new line characters
     	 id, login = row.split(',')		#to split values seperated by a ','
